# Music Player UI

## Techs
* JS, JQuery, HTML5, CSS3

* Developed around a simple MV* concept absent a framework

## Features
* Typical music player functions like pause, fast forward, rewind, play

* Library with simple forms to create new albums and songs

* CMD/Ctrl click provides extra functionality, removing songs from the playlist or adding just a single song from an album at the end of the playlist, rather than the whole rest of the album.

* Simple design aesthetic

## TODO
* JQuery UI Drag and Drop songs
* Backend and actual songs using paperclip and Rails
* Maybe polish design a bit, putting library or playlist in a more clearly delineated sidebar or something
* Shuffle (and unshuffle?)
* Explore other music players to determine preferred characteristics
